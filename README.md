WIP.
A command line app which takes as input an algebraic expression and simplifies it (e.g. "2\*x-(-3)\*4" to "2\*x+12").
It optionally takes values for the variables in the expression, which it uses to simplify the expression further.
If you input "2\*x-(-3)*4" "x=2", then the output would be "16".
Note that quotes around inputs is not required if they do not contain whitespace or the character ^.
