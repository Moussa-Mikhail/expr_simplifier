A command line app which takes as input an algebraic expression (e.g. "2\*x-(-3)\*4") and simplifies them (to "2\*x+12").
It optionally takes values for the variables in the expression, which it uses to simplify it further.
If you input "2\*x-(-3)*4" "x=2", then the output would be "16".
Note that quotes around inputs is not required if they do not contain spaces.
